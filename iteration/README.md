Iteration has been too simple of an understanding. 

Iteration has different geometries. These geometries have a signifcant impact on the feasibility of work.

If I iterate like this, I actually have less mental space for exploration 

It is not just that it is taking more time and students need to be efficent little cogs, it is that there is significant task loading, cognitive load that can make this form of iteration less desirable and less learning happening.
