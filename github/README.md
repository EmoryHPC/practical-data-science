# Practical GitHub for Researchers and Students of Data Science

Why GitHub?

Repository (more commonly called a "repo") and version control tool 

## Setup

Installation of Git (the underlying ENTER)
Create GitHub account 

## GitHub Loop

It helps to think of the process of working with Git and GitHub as a cycle: you begin by making a copy of the project, then move through a series of steps whenever you write code. The basic process looks like this: 

(make visual) 

First clone the code onto you machine. You can clone 

Using SSH: 

```
git@github.com:EmoryHPC/practical-data-science.git
```

or using HTTP: 

```
https://github.com/EmoryHPC/practical-data-science.git
```

Both work, except that GitHub only allows transaction using SSH.

The GitHub workflow mirrors the rhythm of a day:

* Start of the day → Always pull from the repository before you begin. This ensures you're working with the most up-to-date code.
* End of the day → Always push your code when you finish. This saves your progress and makes it available for others to use.

## Version Control

Our work is always provisional and revisable. This is why we use version control.
