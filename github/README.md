# Practical GitHub for Researchers and Students of Data Science

Why GitHub?

Repository (more commonly called a "repo") and version control tool 

## Setup

Installation of Git (the underlying ENTER)
Create GitHub account 

## GitHub Loop

It helps to think of the process of working with Git and GitHub as a cycle: you begin by making a copy of the project, then move through a series of steps whenever you write code. The basic process looks like this: 

(make visual) 

clone

* always pull before working on code 
* always push before the day ends 

## Version Control

Our work is always provisional and revisable. This is why we use version control. 

## Creativity and Room to Err
