SSH stands for Secure Shell. It is a protocol (and a set of tools) used to securely connect to and control remote computers over a network, such as if you were on your laptop and you wanted to connect to a university server.

A typical SSH command looks like this: 

```
ssh username@remote_server
```

placeholder -- this will be about how to get set up with DSCI server
