# What is Practical Data Science? 

Pragmatism says ideas and knowledge are valuable insofar as they produce practical consequences. The true meaning behind ideas and concepts are tied to--and discovered through--their practical effects and their usefulness in guiding action. 

In this sense, Practical Data Science is an approach to data science tools and methods that emphasizes:

* **Actionable over abstract models**. The value of a method is determined not only in elegance, but in whether it informs meaningful decisions.

* **Usefulness over perfection**. Models and tools are judged by their ability to guide meaningful actionâ€”even if they are approximate, heuristic, or incomplete.

* **Context sensitivity**. Data is not treated as neutral but as embedded in specific social, organizational, and ethical contexts; what is "useful" must always be connected to these lived realities.

* **Iterative problem-solving**. Knowledge emerges through cycles of experimentation, feedback, and adjustment rather than from fixed, final answers.

* **Bridging theory and practice**. Like pragmatist philosophy, Practical Data Science refuses to separate theory from application: methods and concepts are evaluated by the consequences they produce when put into practice.

### How to Approach a Problem

Verticle slice, and then inspect every stage 



Discovery Phase 

Open mind without bias 
We want to randomly sample outputs 
Oddities or errors may feel random, but they are never due to randomness. Look for abnormal operations that cause this 


Anomolies are not neutral 


DO NOT FINISH ONE PHASE IN ITS ENTIRETY BEFORE INSPECTING IT
