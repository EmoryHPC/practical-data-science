# What is Practical Data Science? 

Pragmatism says ideas and knowledge are valuable insofar as they produce practical consequences. The true meaning behind ideas and concepts are tied to--and discovered through--their practical effects and their usefulness in guiding action. 

In this sense, Practical Data Science is an approach to data science tools and methods that emphasizes:

* **Actionable over abstract models**. The value of a method is determined not only in elegance, but in whether it informs meaningful decisions.

* **Usefulness over perfection**. Models and tools are judged by their ability to guide meaningful actionâ€”even if they are approximate, heuristic, or incomplete.

* **Context sensitivity**. Data is not treated as neutral but as embedded in specific social, organizational, and ethical contexts; what is "useful" must always be connected to these lived realities.

* **Iterative problem-solving**. Knowledge emerges through cycles of experimentation, feedback, and adjustment rather than from fixed, final answers.

* **Bridging theory and practice**. Like pragmatist philosophy, Practical Data Science refuses to separate theory from application: methods and concepts are evaluated by the consequences they produce when put into practice.
