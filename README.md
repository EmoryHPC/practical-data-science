# What is Practical Data Science? 

Pragmatism says ideas and knowledge are valuable insofar as they produce practical consequences. The value of ideas and concepts are tied to--and discovered through--their practical effects and their usefulness in guiding action. 

In this sense, Practical Data Science is an approach to data science tools and methods that emphasizes:

* **Actionable over abstract methods**. The value of a method is determined not only in elegance, but in whether it informs meaningful decisions.

* **Usefulness over perfection**. Methods and tools are judged by their ability to guide meaningful action—even if they are approximate, heuristic, or incomplete.

* **Context sensitivity**. Neither data, tools, or methods are not treated as neutral but as embedded in specific social, organizational, and ethical contexts; what is "useful" must always be connected to these lived realities.

* **Iterative problem-solving**. Knowledge emerges through cycles of experimentation, feedback, and adjustment rather than from fixed, final answers.

* **Bridging theory and practice**. Like pragmatist philosophy, Practical Data Science refuses to separate theory from application: methods and concepts are evaluated by the consequences they produce when put into practice.

### Practical Data Science Meets Open Science

Open Science emphasizes transparency, reproducibility, collaboration, and accessibility in knowledge production. Practical Data Science naturally aligns with these commitments because both paradigms resist treating knowledge as a static or resticted resource. Instead, they value knowledge as a process—emergent, collective, and open to iteration.

Connections between the two paradigms:

Transparency of process. Iterative, pragmatic cycles of experimentation are strengthened when methods, data, and code are openly shared.

Community feedback. Pragmatism’s emphasis on consequences expands when others can test, critique, and build on methods—core to open science.

Accessibility. Practical usefulness depends on whether others can actually access and apply tools and knowledge such as by viewing code; open science removes barriers.

Ethical responsibility. Context sensitivity demands attention to fairness, justice, and inclusivity—values advanced by open access to research and data.

Thus, Practical Data Science is also a call to embed pragmatist principles into the open science movement. The openness of data, code, and methods creates the very feedback loops pragmatism benefits from.

### How to Approach a Problem, Pragmatically

Verticle slice, and then inspect every stage 

Each project phase should begin with discovery.


Take the Dissentometer project as an example. 

A meta-awareness of the 

Phase I: Data collection from Wikipedia
* Begin scraping data from Wikipedia.
* Check: Is the data being scraped as expected? What information do I need? Do I have all the information that I need?
* Continue scraping data from Wikipedia
* Check again: Is the data being scraped as expected? What information do I need? Do I have all the information that I need?
Phase II: Data translation using a LLM 
Phase III: 



Discovery Phase 

Open mind without bias 
We want to randomly sample outputs 
Oddities or errors may feel random, but they are never due to randomness. Look for abnormal operations that cause this 


Anomolies are not neutral 


DO NOT FINISH ONE PHASE IN ITS ENTIRETY BEFORE INSPECTING IT
